        <strong style="font-family: Sofia" , sans-serif;>Introduction</strong><br>
        I’m Caitlin Johnson, a junior at Kennesaw State University majoring in Information Technology (IT). I absolutely
        love building websites and working on computers—there’s something so satisfying about bringing my ideas to
        life through code! <br><br>


        <br><strong style="font-family: Sofia" , sans-serif;>Background</strong> <br>
        Academically, This year I have made a career change. I was once a Computer Science(CS) major before switching
        over
        to IT. This is my 5th year of college, due to issue with transfering over credits, however, my expected
        graduration
        date is in the Fall of 2025. Personally,I live in Atlanta, GA my entire, also born and raised as well. My love
        for computer came in high school,
        however I was planning to be a art major before, my interest in computers.


        <br> <br> <strong style="font-family: Sofia" , sans-serif;>Experiences</strong> <br>
        Currently, I have entry-level expereince with working in IT. In 2023, I received a internship
        working with "Fulton County Fire Rescue Team", which allowed me to work with real-life firefighters in the field
        or
        on call and working in the IT department in setting up and optimizing iPad devices with necessary applications
        for the firefighters.
        Although, I have entry-level experience, I have been working hard developing and processing projects of my own,
        and
        teaching
        myself and gain knowledge and skills in IT.

        <br><br> <strong style="font-family: Sofia" , sans-serif;>Goals</strong> <br>
        My dream is to work with the FBI or CIA, where I can use my skills to make a real impact.
        I also have big aspirations for the future: I envision myself living in a chic penthouse in London,
        surrounded by all the excitement the city has to offer. I’m determined to chase my dreams and make them a
        reality!
